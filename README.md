This is unstable software, with absolutely no warranty or guarantee whatsoever, whether express or implied, including but not limited to those of merchantability, fitness for specific purpose, or non-infringement.

This package builds upon tm_infra, and provides the following pre-packaged functionalities for codes written with tm_infra:

* Clock (real-time, simulated real-time, or single pass iteration).

* Serialization (mostly CBOR-based), with macros to facilitate the creations of serializable structs.

* Certain classes used in type-level manipulations.

* Logging.

* Certain pre-defined nodes and node combinations.

* Transaction-like requests and service components.

* Nodes reading from and writing to a shared "chain" (linked list.)
